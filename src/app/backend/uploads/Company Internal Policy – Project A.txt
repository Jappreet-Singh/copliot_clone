Company Internal Policy – Project Atlas

Project Atlas is an internal software initiative launched in March 2023.
The project focuses on building a local AI assistant for internal developer productivity.

Key objectives of Project Atlas:
1. Reduce cloud API dependency by using local LLMs.
2. Improve response latency by at least 40%.
3. Support document-based question answering using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Technology stack used in Project Atlas:
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Frontend: Angular
- Vector database: ChromaDB
- Embeddings: Ollama using the model "nomic-embed-text"
- LLM: Phi-3 Mini running locally via Ollama

Important operational constraints:
- Project Atlas must run fully offline.
- No external API calls are permitted in production.
- All sensitive documents must remain on the local machine.

Security note:
Only authorized developers may upload documents into the RAG system.
This policy was last updated on October 15, 2024.
